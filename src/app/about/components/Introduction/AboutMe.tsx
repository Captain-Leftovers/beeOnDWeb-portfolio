			<p className="mt-4 text-lg">
				Hello! I'm Dob, a self-taught Full Stack
				Developer with a passion for coding and
				technology. Over the last three years, I've
				immersed myself in learning the ins and outs of
				web development. From mastering JavaScript to
				exploring the vast capabilities of libraries
				like React, and diving into server-side
				rendering with Next.js, I've enjoyed every bit
				of the journey.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4 text-lg">
				As someone who thrives on challenge and
				problem-solving, coding is more than just a
				profession - it's a hobby and a way of life for
				me. My focus is on writing clean, efficient code
				and building interactive, responsive web
				applications that provide a seamless user
				experience.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4 text-lg">
				Although I'm relatively new to the industry, I'm
				highly motivated, eager to learn, and excited to
				bring my passion for web development to a
				professional setting.
