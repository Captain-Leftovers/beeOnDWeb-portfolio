			<p className="mt-4 text-lg">
				Hello! I&apos;m Dob, a self-taught Full Stack
				Developer with a passion for coding and
				technology. Over the last three years, I&apos;ve
				immersed myself in learning the ins and outs of
				web development. From mastering JavaScript to
				exploring the vast capabilities of libraries
				like React, and diving into server-side
				rendering with Next.js, I&apos;ve enjoyed every bit
				of the journey.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4 text-lg">
				As someone who thrives on challenge and
				problem-solving, coding is more than just a
				profession - it&apos;s a hobby and a way of life for
				me. My focus is on writing clean, efficient code
				and building interactive, responsive web
				applications that provide a seamless user
				experience.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4 text-lg">
				Although I&apos;m relatively new to the industry, I&apos;m
				highly motivated, eager to learn, and excited to
				bring my passion for web development to a
				professional setting.
